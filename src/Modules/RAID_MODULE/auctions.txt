<header2>For raiders<end>

When an auction is running, use
<tab><highlight>/tell <myname> bid 'number'<end>

to place a bid for the item currently being auctioned. This is your maximum
offer which the bot will use to automatically bid against other players
bidding on the same item. The bot will only use up as much of your maximum
offer as necessary to win the auction.

You can also use the same command to increase an already given maximum offer,
but not to lower it.

To get a list of the last auctions, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid history<end>

To search for a specific item in the last auctions, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid history 'search term'<end>


<header2>For raid leaders<end>

To auction an item, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid start 'item'<end>

To cancel a running auction, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid cancel<end>

To end a running auction prematurely, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid end<end>

To refund someone for an accidentally won auction, use
<tab><highlight><symbol>bid refund<end>

This will usually not give back the full amount, but deduct a small
tax, as confugured on the bot.
